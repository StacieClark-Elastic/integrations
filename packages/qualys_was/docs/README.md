# Qualys Web Application Scanning (WAS)

[Qualys WAS](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) integration ingests vulnerability detection data from scans performed by the Qualys Web Application 
Scan product. 
The Qualys Web Application Scanning product is a security product that continuously discovers, 
detects, and catalogs web applications and APIs (Application Programming Interface), uncovers runtime vulnerabilities, 
misconfigurations, Personal Identifying Information (PII) exposures, and web malware across modern web applications 
or APIs.

The Qualys WAS integration uses the REST API mode to collect vulnerability detection data. 
Elastic Agent fetches data via API endpoints. Detection data is augmented by XML based queries to 
the Qualys Knowledge Base about each detection.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against the latest Qualys WAS version **4.5** ,
the **3.0** version REST API, and the **3.0** version of the detection Knowledge Base API.

## Data streams

The Qualys WAS integration collects data vulnerability reports called findings (detections) that are produced from scans. 
Scans are performed on a schedule and/or manually. 
Vulnerability reports are produced from the scans. Vulnerabilities have historical context
such as the first time the vulnerability was seen, the last time the vulnerability was detected
and status updates.
 
The Rest API reference for vulnerability reports: [Rest API guide](https://cdn2.qualys.com/docs/qualys-was-api-user-guide.pdf).
The XML knowledge base api has been updated to 3.0 since this reference was published due to changes in the DTD. The changes
are minimal.

## Requirements for running with an Elastic Agent

- Elastic Agent must be installed.
- You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
- Elastic Agent is required to stream data through the REST API and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Agentless Enabled Integration

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).
Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

You have a few options for installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where it’s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

There are some minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent and for more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

### Permissions

#### Web Application 

| Role   | Module                          | API access |
|--------|---------------------------------|------------|
| Reader | Web Application Scanning Module | Yes        |

## Setup

### To collect data through REST API, follow the below steps:

- Considering you already have a Qualys user account, to identify your Qualys platform and get the API URL, 
refer this [link](https://www.qualys.com/platform-identification/).
- Alternative way to get the API URL is to log in to your Qualys account and go to Help > About. 
You’ll find your URL under Security Operations Center (SOC). Look for a url that starts with "qualysapi"

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana go to Management > Integrations
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar, type Qualys WAS
3. Click on the "Qualys WAS" integration from the search results.
4. Click on the Add Qualys WAS Integration button to add the integration.
5. Add Required Parameters
   - username
   - password
   - url (Example: https://qualysapi.qg2.apps.qualys.com)
   - initial_interval (how far back to look for initial data)
   - interval (how often call API to get latest results)
   - batch size (how many vulnerabilities per page)
6. Select Optional Parameters to filter out data. See https://docs.qualys.com/en/vm/latest/knowledgebase/severity_levels.htm
for descriptions of type of detection data returned and severity levels.
   - disable Information Gathered. 
   - disable Senstive Content
   - disable Verbose
#### Notes about verbose mode
The integration uses verbose mode by default. IN addition to the ingested data enumerated below,
verbose mode returns the history of all scans on the target. If the Qualys WAS application is not configured to
delete old scans, the amount of data that is returned is significant. The agent may experience issues related
to memory exhaustion. Deleting old scans on a schedule will mitigate the issue. Removing old scan data will not affect 
vulnerability reports. If deleting old scans in not an option, other ways to mitigate the issue are:
- turning off verbose mode
- reducing batch size
- increasing memory on the agent 

The additional data available with verbose mode are:
- Web application tags
- OWASP name, code and URL for the detection
- WASC name, code and URL for the detection
- CWE code (becomes ECS value vulnerability.id)
- updatedDateTime
- param value for the test
- results of the most recent scan including the requests made, the response and details what about the response resulted
  in a vulnerability report (stored as flattened data)

## Processing Logic
Cel scripts are used to fetch the data from Qualys endpoints and processed into events that 
are consumed by the pipelines.
The cell script requests Findings (detection) data through the REST API using a filter for the "lastTestedDate",
which is the scan datetime. The qid (qualys id) is the id the vulnerability found that maps to a
knowledge base article in the qualys knowledge base. This id is used to request knowledge base data from an 
endpoint which augments each Finding the knowledge base data. Findings are paginated
by the qualys_was.vulnerability.id, a unique id for the finding. Knowledge base data is cached between pages to reduce
the volume of data transported during a single run of the cel script.
